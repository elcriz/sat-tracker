# Low Earth Orbit Satellite Tracker

A simple, experimental, progressive web application that I can use to track LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites near the user's device's location. Some of these satellites transmit freely available data on frequencies that persons on earth can receive using adequate equipment, such as a HAM transceiver or a radio scanner. Think of [APT weather satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_picture_transmission) such as NOAA 19, NOAA 18 and NOAA 15. Data by N2YO.com.

## Current satellites

- [NOAA 19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-19) (American, Weather, Amateur Radio)
- [NOAA 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-18) (American, Weather, Amateur Radio)
- [NOAA 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOAA-15) (American, Weather, Amateur Radio)
- [METOP-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetOp) (European, Weather)

This is  a work in progress, so bear with me...
