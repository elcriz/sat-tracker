# Low Earth Orbit Satellite Tracker

A simple progressive web application that I can use to track LEO (Low Earth Orbit) sattellites near my location. Some of these satellites transmit freely available data on frequencies that persons on earth can receive using adequate equipment, such as a HAM transceiver or a radio scanner. Think of the International Space Station (ISS) or weather satellites (e.g. NOAA 19, NOAA 18 and NOAA 15). Data by N2YO.com.

This is, needless to say, a work in progress, so bear with me.
